# Hand Tracking Module

This project is basically made, so that it can be used in any other live hand related project. This Hand Tracking Module tracks the point of hand. It uses two main libraries, opencv for image processing and mediapipe for tracking the points of hand.

The module detects the hand and then finds the positions of all the points. The module can be used in projects where we want to track certain points of hands and returns it position.

To deploy this project run download the python file and first check with the version of python you are using, just to ensure if it works well. (I have made this project with python 3.11)


## Features

- Easy to use
- Can be applied to various image processing projects
- Make the overall project simpler
